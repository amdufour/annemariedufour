            <h3>How is it to work with me?</h3>
            <p>With my background in engineering, design, frontend web development and project management, I can tackle projects from raw data to a full fledged digital or printed visualization.  I am also available to jump in for a specific stage of a project, wheter it is data analysis, design or development. I mostly work on my own, but Iâ€™m always happy to be part of a broader team or to lead collaborators from different disciplines toward the creation of an outstanding experience.</p>
            <p>My signature is an obsession for these little details that make a project rise WAY beyond average. With my design touches, custom animations and UX considerations, I alway aim at creating a memorable experience. And the liveliness (gusto?) I bring to the table makes the experience memorable on a human level as well !</p>

She is ready to face challenges outside of her comfort zone and, on top of that, she delivers with outstanding quality. I can only recommend her services to myself and around me.</p>
