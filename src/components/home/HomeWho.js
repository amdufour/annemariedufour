            <h3>How is it to work with me?</h3>
            <p>My engineering, design, front-end development, and project management backgrounds allow me to tackle projects from raw data to full-fledged digital or printed visualization. I also enjoy jumping in for a specific project stage, whether it is data analysis, design, or development. I mostly work on my own, but Iâ€™m always happy to be part of a broader team or lead collaborators from different disciplines toward creating an outstanding experience.</p>
            <p>My signature is an obsession for these little details that make a project rise WAY beyond average. With my enthusiasm, UX considerations, and unique designs, I aim to create a memorable experience for the end-user AND my collaborators.</p>

She is ready to face challenges outside of her comfort zone, and, on top of that, she delivers outstanding quality. I can only recommend her services to myself and around me.</p>
