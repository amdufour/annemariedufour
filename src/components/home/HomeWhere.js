            <h2>Sounds interesting! But where can we use Data Visualizations?</h2>
            <p>When thinking about Data Visualizations, the first images that come to my mind are the stunning graphics in National Geographic articles. But sky is the limit! From physical installations, to fashion, to postcards (go take a look here if you donâ€™t know what I mean by postcards), the support possibilities are endless.</p>
            <p>The 2 main visualizations supports are Digital and Printed. These are commonly used for expository visualizations, where the dataset is fixed. Often, the data has been massaged to expose trends and outliers. On the other hand, Dashboards deal with an ever evolving stream of data and are an exploratory type of visualization.</p>

            <h3>Digital supports</h3>

            <h3>Printed publications</h3>
            <p>Visualizations add depth and context to the text in magazine or journal articles. They are a key asset in report to impress stakeholders. On poster or t-shirts, they are used to raise awareness or simply for their eye catching qualities.</p>
